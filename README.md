# Vehicle Number Plate Compliance Detection

## Project Overview

This project implements an AI-based system to automatically detect whether vehicle number plates comply with government regulations using image classification. The system helps identify non-compliant or customized number plates that do not follow the standardized font and style mandated by the government.

---

## Features

* Upload vehicle number plate images for analysis
* Classifies number plates as compliant or non-compliant
* Uses a trained AI model based on Google Teachable Machine
* Supports integration into mobile/web apps for easy accessibility

---

## Dataset

* Primary data collected via image uploads
* Secondary data sourced from Kaggle
* Dataset includes images of number plates under various conditions

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Google Teachable Machine for model training
* TensorFlow.js for running the model directly in the browser
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend web development

---

## How It Works

1. User visits the website and uploads a number plate image.
2. The image is processed in-browser by the AI model to check compliance.
3. The website displays whether the number plate follows government rules or not.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-plate-compliance.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred environment.
3. Follow instructions in the `/docs` folder (if available) to run the app and test the model.
4. Upload images to test compliance detection.
